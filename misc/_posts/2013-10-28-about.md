## Joining the lab

<!-- TODO add pictures -->
We're always looking for smart, dynamic students to join the lab. Any students that are interested in working with us should look through our [research projects](/research); if you find one you're interested in joining, reach out to the graduate student(s) associated directly. Otherwise, please email [Professor Etienne-Cummings](/team/rec). We're excited to hear from you!

## Site Design

This website has been adapted from two fantastic lab websites: the [Bedford Lab](https://bedford.io) and the [Drummond Lab](https://drummondlab.org). We use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to generate the stack and host everything locally. The source code for the site can be found on [Github](https://github.com/csmslab/csmssite).
