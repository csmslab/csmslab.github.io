## Site Design

This website has been adapted from two fantastic lab websites: the [Bedford Lab](https://bedford.io) and the [Drummond Lab](https://drummondlab.org). We use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to generate the stack and host everything locally. The source code for the site can be found on [Github](https://github.com/csmslab/csmssite).
