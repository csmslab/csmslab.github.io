The tool for layout creation is called VIRTUOSO. In the Library Manager
highlight the inv cell in the **digital_lib** library. Left
click **Library Manager:File->New->Cell View** in the cell
view of the inv type layout and click OK.

Two windows should have appeared. The Virtuoso Layout Editing window,
and the LSW window. The LSW window is the one you will use to choose the
different layers of the IC design. The LSW window is divided in three
main categories which are: color, layer and purpose.

-   Color: Matches the color in the Editing window. Each layer has its own color and pattern.
-   Layer: What is the type of layer (Active, Metal1, Poly, Metal2, etc)
-   Purpose: drw = drawing, pn = pin.

Each layer has two colors associated with it; a fill color and an
outline color. These colors can be changed to fit your taste by editing
the technology file.

Now we are going to build the layout of the inverter. An inverter has an
NMOS and a PMOS transistor. First we will build an NMOS transistor.

You can use **Ctrl-Z** to zoom in and use **Shift-Z** to zoom out

Left click **LSW: Active drw**

Left click **Editing: Create -> Rectangle**

Left click: **Hide**

Notice that when the mouse is inside of the Editing window that the X
and Y coordinate values (found between the title bar and the menu bar)
change. These are very handy in making layouts. Also, notice the
dX and dY items. When creating shapes, these show
how far in each direction you have moved the cursor (since the last
click).

From this point on, when I want you to click at a certain point in the
Editing window, I will give you the X and Y coordinates in standard
Cartesian form: (X,Y). If you make a mistake at any time you can left
click on **Editing:Edit->Undo**. Also you can use move, copy,
stretch and delete. Take some time to play with these controls and see
how they work.

If you are unable to select the exact coordinates make sure your display
is set to the right snap spacing. Left click **Editing: Options ->
Display** and make sure X Snap Spacing is 0.09 and Y Snap Spacing is
0.09. This snaps the cursor to move in increments of 0.09 microns.

Draw a few rectangles to make the following shape of the PMOS diffusion.
The dimension of the rectangles of shown below. To get the ruler, Press
the hotkey `K`. To get rid of all the rulers, use the hotkey
`Shift-K`

Now we replicate the same diffusion for NMOS. You can press the left
mouse key to select everything and press **C** to copy them.

[![Diffusion_NMOS.jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/manual/Diffusion_NMOS.jpg)

Now, let put the Metal_1 to diffusion contacts (also known as
vias).

Left click **LSW. cc drw**

Left click **Editing: Create -> Rectangle**

The dimension of the contacts are shown below:

![cc_tsmc.jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/manual/cc_tsmc.jpg)

Handy tip: When drawing many of the same things (rectangles, polygons,
etc) you can just right click the mouse to repeat the last operation
(draw rectangle, draw polygon, etc.)

A via connects the active region to a metal1 layer. A via cannot go
through more than one layer. There are three different types of
vias to connect all the from poly to metals, and between all
6 layers of metals in this process.

Now let's draw the **Pselect** around the PMOS:

Left click **LSW. Pselect drw**

![pselect_tsmc.jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/manual/pselect_tsmc.jpg)

Everything (that's visible) inside the **Pselect** (active)
region will be doped as a P-type semiconductor (excess of holes). Since
the transistor is of the N-type, it creates a diode junction between the
N-doped regions and the P-substrate (The silicon wafer is P-type). This
gives a direct connection into the substrate so that we can ensure that
the diodes are reverse biased (no current will flow).

Now let\'s draw the **Nselect** for the NMOS

Left click **LSW: Nselect drw**

![nselect_tsmc.jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/manual/nselect_tsmc.jpg)

Now let's draw the Nwell around the PMOS.

Left click **LSW. Nwell drw**

![nwell_tsmc.jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/manual/nwell_tsmc.jpg)

Now let's draw the gates of the NMOS and PMOS using Polysilicon

Left click **LSW: Poly drw**

![poly_tsmc.jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/manual/poly_tsmc.jpg)

Now we have finished making the transistors. But all the transistors
need Bulk connections. Now we will draw the bulk for NMOS and PMOS using
the Diffusion, N-select, P-select, and Visa.

![bulk_tsmc.jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/manual/bulk_tsmc.jpg)

You have just finished building a NMOS and a PMOS transistor. Poly
crossing active is a transistor. Where the poly actually crosses is the
gate of the transistor. Everything we are doing is in units of microns
Notice that the gate is 0.18 microns long. The smallest possible length
of the gate is being used.

Now let's connect all the terminal using Metal 1.

Left click **LSW. Metal1 drw**

![M1_tsmc.jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/manual/M1_tsmc.jpg)

We have finished making an Inverter!

Now it is time to add pins. Pins are used to extract the layout and use
it from LVS (layout vs. schematic) to ensure the layout match the
schematic.

Left click **LSW: Metal1 drw**

Left click **Editing: Create -> Pin...** The Create Pin form should
appear.

Ensure that *I/O Type* is set to **inputOutput**. It is important that this type matches the pin type used in the schematic to prevent warnings. Also make
sure that Create label option is checked or otherwise the label names
will not appear in the design. Ensure, also, that the **Display Pin
Name** box is checked. Type **vdd** in the *Terminal Names*
box. Make sure the mode is set to **rectangle**. Left click **Hide**.

Draw a rectangle and place the txt next to the rectangle you just made.

![vdd_tsmc.jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/manual/vdd_tsmc.jpg)

Now draw 2 more pins for **vss** and **out**, using M1 pin

![M1_pins_tsmc.jpg]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/manual/M1_pins_tsmc.jpg)

Now, let's place the pin **in** on the gate of the transistors

Left click **LSW: Poly drw**

Left click **Editing: Create -> Pin...**

Ensure all the switches are properly set and type **in** in
the *Terminal Names* box.

You have just finished the layout phase of the inverter. Save your
design. Be sure to save early and often. It's a guarantee that the
first time you forget to save (especially in a big design after a lot of
changes), the machine will crash and you will lose all your work. Your
layout should look like the one below.
