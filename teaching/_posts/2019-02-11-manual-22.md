Simulating an inverter is very straight forward process. The only
thing we need to do is start Verilog-XL simulator and specify a
simulation file. If we want to simulate bigger circuits (for example a
train of inverters), we need first to create a schematic consisted of
basic cells whose behavioral model is already specified. In our case of
a train of five inverter, create a new schematic and connect the five
inverters and specify the input, output, Vdd and Vss pins. Then run
Verilog-XL on this schematic. Verilog will follow the hierarchy of the
circuit and it will create the necessary net list for the Verilog
simulation.

### Running a Verilog Simulation

Left click **CIW:Tools-\>Verilog Integration-\>Verilog-XL**. The *Setup
Environment* windows should appear. Fill in the appropriate fields as
shown in the figure. It is recommended that you run your simulation in
the local /tmp directory on the machine. Usually your simulation will
run faster.

Left Click **OK**. The *Verilog-XL Integration Control* window should
appear. There are (for us) three very important buttons on the control
panel. The two that are currently active (not greyed out) are *Start
Interactive* in the upper left corner of the panel, and the *View
Waveforms* button in the lower right corner of the panel. The third is
the *Continue* button (currently greyed out) - the second button in the
second row of the panel. Left click **Verilog-XL: Stimulus -\> Verilog**

A warning box should appear, left click **Yes.** You want to create a
new stimulus file for the Verilog simulation. Select the **Edit** Mode
button and select the **testfixture.verilog** This window should look
like the one on the next page. You can specify a different name for the
stimulus file, but this requires manipulation with the copy option in
the window below. This is left to the reader as an exercise.

Left Click **OK** and a new text tool should appear. In the text tool
you are going to write the stimulus file.

Note: If you are having difficulties starting a text tool, you can go to
the directory where your Verilog simulation is specified and use vi or
emac to edit the stimuli file.

As in the behavioral model, anything following a \"//\" is considered to
be a comment. After the comment lines, make the file look like this:

    initial

    begin

    io\_vdd = 1\'bz;

    io\_vss = 1\'bz;

    \#5 io\_in=1\'b1;

    \#5 io\_in=1\'b0;

    \#5 io\_in=1\'b1;

    \#20 \$finish;

    end

The program above use the following commands:

-   initial - starts initialization of the simulation.
-   begin - marks the beginning of the simulation file. Between *begin*
and *end* is where the test pattern(s) should be written.
-   io - the input/output pin of the simulation.
-   io\_in = 1\'b0 - this says that the input pin shall have an
initial value of 0. The b means that it is a binary input (binary 0 =
OV, binary 1 = 5V). The 1\' tells the simulation engine that it is a
single bit input (4\' would signify 4 bits).
-   \#5 - represents 5 nanoseconds (in our case ). The \# can be defined
as another time unit elsewhere.
-   \#5 in = 1 - This tells the simulation engine that 5ns after the
last event, that this event should take place (the in pin changes to a
binary 1).
-   \$finish - Tells the simulation engine that there is nothing more to
run.
-   end- signifies the end of the simulation test fixture.

Now save the file and close it. You should see again your Stimulus
Option window. Now click on the **Select** button in the upper corner.
Select the **testfixture.verilog** file. Left click on the **OK** button
and you are ready to run the simulation.

To start the simulation, left click **Verilog-XL: Simulation-\>Start
Interactive**

The Verilog-XL is going to create a net list for your file. If it
prompts you to renetlist the design, answer **No.** When the net list is
created the simulator stops and waits for further instructions from the
user. At this point you can use different debugging tool for your
program. You can set breaks, watches, step through and others. In our
case, we want to run the whole stimulus file. Go to **Verilog-XL:
Simulation-\>Continue.** After the process is complete go to
**VERILOG-XL: DEBUGING-\>Utilities-\>View Waveform**.

Shortly you should see the Simvison waveform viewer. Go to **File-\>Open
Database** and find the directory for your verilog run. Inside you
should find a subdirectory called RunObject.0. Keep on descending into
subdirectories (there should only be one in each) until you find
**shm.trn.** Select it and hit **Open**.

In the browser window that tops up, open up the tree on the left hand
side that says shm. Inside there should be a list of signals. Select
**in** and **out**, and hit the button **Send to Waveform**. Its on the
top right hand side - a black square with pictures of digital waveforms.

Now the waveforms should show up in the main window.
