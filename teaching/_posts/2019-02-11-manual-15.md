You\'ve created a layout. Now, you need to check that you didn\'t
violate any design rules (Metal1 to close to Metal1, etc.). Left click
**Editing: Verify -\> DRC**.

The DRC window should open.

The DRC window should appear as above. Make sure the rules file is:
**\~divaDRC.rul**. No switches need to be selected so make sure the
Switch Names field is blank.

If there are no errors, the CIW window will display \"Total errors
found: 0\" (this may take a few seconds). If any errors are found, they
will be displayed in the CIW output window, and will also be highlighted
in the Editing window. Read the MOSIS rules (included at the end of this
manual or you can download them from www.mosis.com) and correct all
mistakes. If you would like to know which rule was violated, left click
**Editing: Verify -\> Markers -\> Explain**. Then left click on the
marker. An explanation window should appear.

If you do not want to see these annoying blinking markers, left click
**Editing: Verify -\> Markers -\> Delete All\...** A dialog box will
appear. Just left click **OK**.\
