To create a new library, first start cadence and open the Library Manager as usual (**CIW:Tools -> Library Manager**). In the Library Manager, click **File->New->Library**.


A dialog box should appear and you should fill the appropriate boxes
as shown in the picture:

You can choose any name for the library. In this case we have chosen **digital_lib** for the library name. The _Design Manager Use_ option should be left to **No DM**.

We will have to compile a technology file with this new library. First, select **Compile a new techfile**. Next, select **TSMC 0.18u CMOS018/DEEP (6M, HV FET, sblock)** from the drop down menu beside _Compile tech library_. Click OK.

The new technology file will be compiled and placed in the directory where your library is located. This techfile specifies the type of devices we'll use in the library. Your library is created now and you should be able to locate the new library called **digital_lib** in your Library Manager.

Translating our techfile:
-   **TSMC**: Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company - the manufacturer of this design.
-   **0.18u**: $0.18\mu$ minimum transistor size in this design
-   **CMOS**: Complimentary Metal Oxide Transistors - the type of technology
