In order to do a DC Analysis on an extracted view, we will actually use
the schematic to choose our sweep component, but then run the simulation
on the extracted view. We will use the **inv_test** schematic
because it already has voltage sources set up. First open the
**schematic** view of **inv_test**.

 

Left click **Editing:Tools->Analog Environment**. The
analog Artist window will appear. In order to test the extracted view,
we must change the environment by left click **Setup->Environment...**

Here you will see various text under the **Switch View List**, one of
which being \'schematic\'.

 

To test the extracted rather than the schematic, we must change
'schematic' to 'extracted' as shown below.

 

Note: this is a very useful tool when simulations need to be done on
various views for various parts. The program will simulate for
components on the listed views, taking the leftmost view as the priority
and continuing down the list if this view cannot be simulated.

Now, we can test in the exact same way we swept DC for the schematic:

Left click **Analyses->Choose...** and choose the **in** voltage to
sweep from **0V-1.8V**.

Left click **Outputs->To be Plotted...** and choose the in and the out
nets to be plotted.

Then left click **Simulation->Run** and you should see a similar plot
to the one from the schematic test.
