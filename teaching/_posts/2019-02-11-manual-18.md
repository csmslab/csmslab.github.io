The actual simulation on the
layout will be performed on the *Extracted* cell view of the inverter.
This cell view contains all the information necessary for Spice
Simulation.

In the Library Manager,
double click on the **Extracted** cell view of the **inv**. A new
editing window with the analog extracted version of your inverter should
appear.

Left click
**Editing:Tools->Analog Environment**. The analog Artist
window will appear. We will perform a transient analysis on the layout
of the inverter and the steps are very similar to the ones we described
earlier.

Left click
**Analysis->Choose**. Specify a transient analyses to
**10n**

Left click **Outputs->To be plotted->Select on schematic**. Now click on the poly pin of the input
pin and on the metal pin of the output pin. The poly and metal layer
will change color, indicating that they are selected for plotting the
results.

Go back in your Analog
Environment window. Now we need to specify how the pins of the layout
are connected. We need to specify that the *vdd* and
*vss* pins are connected to 5 volts and ground respectively.
Also we need to specify an input pulse source to the *in* pin. We are
going to specify this with the graphical stimulus
editor.

Left click **Analog
Environment:Setup->Stimulus->Edit Analog**. In the new
window click graphical to begin editing the stimulus.


First connect *vdd*
and *gnd* to the appropriate voltages. Select *vdd*,
check **enabled,** make sure function is **dc** and type in **1.8**
under DC voltage and hit the **change** button. Do the same for
*gnd* but with **0**.

Now connect the input to a
voltage pulse by selecting and enabling it. Change the function to
**pulse.** Put **0** for **Voltage 1** and **1.8** for voltage 2. Refer
to the picture below for the detailed transient simulation settings.

Hit okay and run the
simulation now by clicking on **Simulate->Run**. You should observe
similar results to the ones you obtained from the transient analysis on
the schematic.
