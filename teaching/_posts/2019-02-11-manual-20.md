Verilog is a description language that describes the behavior of a logic
circuit at gate level. It can also be used for simulation of a logic
designs. It does not just simulate the function of the circuit but also
the delays for switching each gate.

The first step in running a Verilog simulation is to create the
behavioral files for each gate that you wish to simulate. From the
schematic file you can then run the simulation of the total design you
have created. The last step is to evaluate the results from the input
and output waveforms in a program called SimVision
