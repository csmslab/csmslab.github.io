Bring up the schematic of **inv_test**. We need to replace the dc voltage input source with a pulse source. Click on the **vdc** source that is connected to the input of the inverter. The **vdc** should have a yellow box around it. Go to **Editing:Edit->Delete** or press the `Del` button.

Left Click **Add->Instance** and select Cell Name: **vpulse** from **Library Name: NCSU_Analog_parts** and **View Name:symbol**. Fill the rest of the boxes as shown in the figure on the next page. The input pulse that we have specified is bounded between 0 and 1.8V. It has an initial delay of 1ns, rise and fall time of 1ps and high/low duration of 2ns.**

Place this symbol such that the positive end is connected to the input
of the inverter. Refer to the next page for the end
result.

Save the schematic. Left Click **Editing:Design->Check
and Save.** After we have made these changes we are ready to run a
transient analysis on the inverter.

Left Click **Editting:Tools->Analog Environment**. In
the Analog Environment window go to **Analysis->Choose**. Set the
transient analysis with **Stop Time** as **8n**. We have specified a
transient analysis from 0 to 8ns.

Left Click **Analog Environment: Outputs->To be Plotted->Select on
Schematic**. Select the input and output of the inverter. Refer to the
previous section, DC analysis, for the necessary
steps.

Run the simulation by pressing on the green traffic light icon and
observe the results of the transient analysis. Now you can edit your
results and print them out.
