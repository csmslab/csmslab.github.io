Open the **inv_test** file from the **digital_lib_test** library. In the schematic of **inv_test**, left click **Editing:Tools -> Analog Environment.** The spectre window should appear.

First, change the simulator to spectreS by left click **Analog Environment:Setup->Simulator/Directory/Host...** and choose **spectreS** as the simulator. Always choose spectreS for all simulations.

We want to specify the type of analysis we want to perform. We are going to select a DC analysis. Left click **Analog Environment:Analyses->Choose**. Click on the **dc** button for Analysis. Click **Component Parameter** button for sweep variable. In the **Sweep Range,** fill **0 and 1.8V** for the start and stop. Left click on the **Select Component**. Now go back to the schematic and select the voltage source you want to sweep. Click on the vdc that is connected to the input of the inverter. This will pop-up a small window, which requests the Parameter Name. Click on **dc** to sweep the voltage. Go back to your Analysis Choose window, which should look like the one below, and click on OK.

Second, we want to select which output voltages to be plotted. Left click on **Analog Environment:** **Outputs->To be Plotted->Select on Schematic.** Click on the wire between your vdc source and the _in_ pin of your inverter. Then click on the wire between the _out_ pin of the inverter and the _out_ pin. Both wires should change color indicating that these voltages will be plotted.

_Note:_ If you want to select a current to be plotted, then click on the square of a symbol where the current is flowing through. There will be a circle around the square node indicating that a current is selected.

In order to make your simulation more readable, it is often advisable to name special nets with uniquely identifiable names, so that when the simulation results are presented, they are more easily understood. To do this, on the **inverter_test** schematic press the `l` (label) key, type in the word **in**, in this case, and "attach" it to the input wire. Now on the Analog Environment, click on the **net4** net and then on the eraser to the right. Finally, reselect **Outputs->To be plotted->Select on Schematic** and click on your input wire. **in** should appear where **net4** used to be.

You are ready to run the simulation. Left Click **Simulation->Run** or click on the **green traffic light icon** in the Analog Environment window. The result window, as the one below will appear shortly. Explore the pull down menus in this window in order to customize your results. For instance, left click **Axes->Strip** in order to separate the different curves.

To save the results left click **Waveform Window: file->save as image**.

Now exit the Cadence Spice. Left click on **Analog Environment:Session->Quit**.
