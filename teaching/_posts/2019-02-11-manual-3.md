**After you have an account created on the ECE server, setup the cadence
environment using the following steps**

-   Open a new terminal window with `Ctl-Alt-T` or by right-clicking the desktop and selecting "Open in terminal"
-   Make a new directory with the command `mkdir ECE491` (or `ECE216` for Intro to VLSI). This is where all your Cadence files will be located.
-   Change your working directory to the new directory `with cd ECE491`.
-   Set up Cadence by typing `cadence ncsu`.
    -   You only need to run this command the first time you use Cadence (or when you create a new Cadence directory).
    -   Note: `ncsu` must be in lowercase for this to work.
-   Start Cadence by typing `cadence` from the ECE491 directory
