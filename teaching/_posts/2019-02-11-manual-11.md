Now that we have built an inverter, we need to simulate it to show that our design is valid. Before proceeding with simulating the inverter circuit, we should create a new library for testing our digital circuits. This way we can separate out the primary digital cells from the test schematics. Create a new library called **digital\_lib\_test** in your working directory. Follow the same steps as describe earlier when creating the **digital\_lib** library.

First we need to create a new cell in **digital\_lib\_test** library for testing our inverter. It is a good practice to keep separate your cell with your test files. In the Library Manager, highlight the **digital\_lib\_test** library and left click on **Library Manager:File-\>New-\>Cell View**.

In the Cell Name type **inv\_test** and in the View Name type schematic. Left click on OK.

A new schematic editing tool will appear. You are going to instance the inverter that was previously created and connect its input and vdd pin to voltage sources. The output pin will be connected to a capacitor while the _gnd_ pin will be grounded.

Left click **Editing:Add-\>Instance**. Click on the **Browse** button and using the Library Manager select from the **digital\_lib** library, the **inv** cell, with **symbol** view. Then close the Library Manager. The Add Component window should look like this:

Place the inverter in the middle of the editing window. Now we want to add voltage DC sources. Left Click **Editing: Add-\>Instance**. In the Library Name field type **NSCU\_Analog\_Parts**; in the Cell Name type **gnd** and then place the symbol bellow the inverter. Left Click **Editing:Add-\>Instance.** In the Library Name field type **NSCU\_Analog\_Parts**; in the Cell Name type **vdc**; in the Cell View type **symbol**. In the DC Voltage field enter **1.8V**. This window should appear as such:

Place one copy of the voltage source above the inverter and one next to the input of the inverter. The value of the voltage source which will be connected to the input of the inverter is not important because this voltage source will be swept during the DC analysis.

We want to add capacitor to the output pin in order to simulate a load (other circuits) that our inverter has to charge or discharge. Left click **Editing:Add-\>Component**. From the **NSCU\_Analog\_Parts** library choose a cell named **cap** and specify its value to be **1fF**.

Next we will add an output pin in the schematic. Left click **Editing:Add-\>Pin?**. Name the pin **out** and specify it as an input/output pin. Place the pin next to the output of the inverter.

Connect all the elements as shown in the figure bellow. To connect different elements use **Editing:Add-\>Wire**

Save the schematic and you are ready to simulate the inverter.
