In order to do post-layout simulation and layout versus schematic
comparison (LVS), you need to do a layout extraction first as an
intermediate step.

Left click **Editing: Verify -> Extract\...**

The Extractor dialog box should appear. Ensure that you have specified
the rule file (\`divaEXT.rul)and the *Switch Names* is set to blank.
Left click OK.

If there are no errors, the CIW window will display \"Total errors
found: 0\" (this may take a few seconds). Now you should be able to see
another cell view of the **inv** named **extracted** in your Library
Manager
