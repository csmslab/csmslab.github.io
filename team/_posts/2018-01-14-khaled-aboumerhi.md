Khaled received his BS in Electrical Engineering from the University of Cincinnati with a minor in nanotechnology. While at UC, Khaled worked with Marc Cahay on simulating electron wave-packet propagation through nano-scale devices. As an undergraduate research fellow working with Gerhard Klimeck at Purdue University, Khaled used NEMO5 to contribute to the Quantum Dot Lab, a nano-crystal visualization tool hosted on <https://nanohub.org>. His current academic interests include bio-electronics, bio-inspired electronics, and neuroprosthetics. He is currently working on a closed-loop diaphragmatic pacemaker. In his free time, Khaled enjoys playing the violin and loves yoga and the outdoors.
