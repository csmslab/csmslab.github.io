# Abstract
Imaging of cortical vasculature in rodents and its dynamic response to experimental conditions, yield valuable information regarding the underlying physiological mechanisms of neuronal activity. Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) facilitates both enhanced micro-vessel visualization and blood flow information. The current state of equipment used: the imaging systems, the external lighting as well as the recording apparatus constrain modern imaging to bench-top experiments with anaesthetized rodents. We describe an imaging system that attempts to shift this paradigm to be capable of imaging awake and behaving rodents in a completely unrestrained manner. To this end, we present a novel integrated optics microscope weighting 7 g and occupying less than 4 cc, coupled with a backpack system weighting 22 g and measuring 2.5×4×2 cm3. The system is capable of providing controlled laser illumination …
