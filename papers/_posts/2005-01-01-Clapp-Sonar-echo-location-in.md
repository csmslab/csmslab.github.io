# Abstract
Sonar array technology enables sensing of both range and angle bearing of objects with respect to the array. Instead of relying on a narrow angle of transmission and reception and multiple sensor positions, one array can receive returns from a large area and still offer angular localization of targets. We have designed and constructed array processing circuitry that uses mixed-signal spatiotemporal frequency filtering in order to extract wavefront velocity across the array. From wavefront velocity, the angular bearing of a return is determined. This system was demonstrated in a functional test using single and multiple objects. The 2D performance is presented here.
