# Abstract
A complete neural recording ASIC based on Compressive Sensing (CS) is demonstrated. Implemented using efficient digital circuit, this CS technique is able to achieve 10 times data compression while consuming only 0.83uW (@0.53VDD) additional digital power per electrode. Since CS performance is strongly signal dependent, the ASIC has been tested with standard public database. The characteristic spikes and inter-spike data can be recovered while guarantee >95% spike classification success rate. The complete signal processing circuit consumes <;16uW/electrode.
