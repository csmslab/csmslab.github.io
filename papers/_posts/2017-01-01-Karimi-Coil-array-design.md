# Abstract
One of the main challenges for the deployment of sub-mm sized implantable device is the limit on the power that can be transmitted to these devices through inductive link. We first obtain the optimal sizing of the coils in the link and the maximum power that can be delivered to a 300 pm × 300 pm using single transmitting coil at operating frequency of 1.1 GHz. To increase the delivered power, we introduce and optimize the design of phased coil array at the transmitting side taking into account the safety limits. By adding a single coil we achieve a gain of 1.43 dB in the delivered power, while with the addition of four transmitting coils, the power that can be delivered to the implantable device is increased by 4.3 dB and reaches 10.6 μW.
