# Abstract
A low-voltage current-mode active pixel sensor (APS) capable of operating from a 1 V power supply in a 0.35 /spl mu/m standard CMOS process is proposed. The pixel utilizes a PMOS transistor biased in the linear region of operation to produce an output current linearly proportional to the integrated voltage. The 10/spl times/10 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ fabricated pixel has a 32% fill factor and an adjustable conversion gain of 6.3 pA/e~. This paper presents an analysis and simulations of the image sensor.
