# Abstract
Should research and development efforts in imaging technology pay special attention to biology for inspiration? An affirmative answer would have to contend with the obvious technical ascendancy of modern medical imaging systems, such as computerassisted tomography, or magnetic resonance imagery, not to mention the pace of innovation in the ubiquitous cell phone camera, none of which can be called "bioinspired." Laser-based devices, such as twophoton microscopy, have revolutionized imaging in neurobiology, but owe their fundamentals to discoveries in physics. Satellite imaging systems commonly exploit hyperspectral approaches, which run counter to almost anything found in biology.On the other side of the ledger, discoveries in biological research continually bring to light an astonishing array of specialized sensory systems that animals use to scan the natural environment, or to control their own visibility. Even seemingly unrelated work in molecular genetics can have unpredictable extensions into imaging technology. To cite one salient example, the discovery of how to use microbial opsin genes to genetically sensitize neurons to infrared light has led to what the journal Science has called an "Insight of the Decade".
