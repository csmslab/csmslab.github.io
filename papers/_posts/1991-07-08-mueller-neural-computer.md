# Abstract
A programmable analog neural computer and selected applications are described. The machine was assembled from over 100 custom VLSI modules containing neurons, synapses, routing switches, and programmable synaptic time constants. Connection symmetry and modular construction allow expansion to arbitrary size. The network runs in real-time analog mode. Connection architecture as well as neuron and synapse parameters are controlled by a digital host that monitors the network performance through a digital/analog interface. Programming and monitoring software has been developed. Several application examples, including the dynamic decomposition of acoustical patterns, are described. The machine is intended to real-time, real-world computations. In current configuration its maximal speed is equivalent to that of a digital machine capable of more than $10^12$ FLOPS.
