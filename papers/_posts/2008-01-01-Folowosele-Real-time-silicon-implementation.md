# Abstract
We present a real-time implementation of the V1 stage of the hierarchical model of object recognition in the primate visual cortex with 2400 simple cells and 80 complex cells. This emulation of the visual information processing in the primateâ€™s visual cortex has the potential for ultra-fast object recognition that will outperform current, computer vision-based methods.
