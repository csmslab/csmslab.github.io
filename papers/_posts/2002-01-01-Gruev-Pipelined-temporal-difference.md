# Abstract
A 189/spl times/182 active pixel sensor for temporal difference computation is presented. The temporal difference imager, fabricated in an AM1 0.5 /spl mu/m process, contains in-pixel storage elements for previous and current frames. A pipelined architecture for difference readout is implemented, allowing >200 fps, 42 dB signal-to-noise ratio images and 8-bit precision of the difference image. The chip consumes 30 mW at 50 fps from a 5 V power supply.
