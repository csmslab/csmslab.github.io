# Abstract
Post operative retained foreign bodies are a rare but recalcitrant problem. We detail reports of interventions over the last two centuries and review the most current interventions using automated data identity capture and computer aided detection. This was one of earliest areas in which multidisciplinary collaboration was achieved in patient safety. This multidisciplinary collaboration was unique because most other initiatives had been internal: among the disciplines working in the OR i.e. surgeons, nurses and anesthesiologists; this collaboration, to achieve optimal patient safety at that point in time was between surgeons and radiologists to ensure a lack of post operative retained foreign bodies.
