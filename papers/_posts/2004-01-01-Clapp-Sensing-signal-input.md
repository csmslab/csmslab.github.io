# Abstract
A system is presented to process ultrasonic signals from an array of MEMS microphones to determine the angle of incidence of the original signal. Apparent velocity of the wavefront across the array is processed using spatiotemporal filters, each tuned to a different velocity. Simulation results demonstrate one-degree accuracy for SNR> 14 dB.
