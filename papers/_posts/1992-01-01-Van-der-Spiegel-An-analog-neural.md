# Abstract
A multichip analog parallel neural network whose architecture, neuron characteristics, synaptic connections, and time constants are modifiable is described. The system has several important features, such as time constants for time-domain computations, interchangeable chips allowing a modifiable gross architecture, and expandability to any arbitrary size. Such an approach allows the exploration of different network architectures for a wide range of applications, in particular dynamic real-world computations. Four different modules (neuron, synapse, time constant, and switch units) have been designed and fabricated in a 2- mu m CMOS technology. About 100 of these modules have been assembled in a fully functional prototype neural computer. An integrated software package for setting the network configuration and characteristics, and monitoring the neuron outputs has been developed as well. The …
