# Abstract
The following paper describes the design and preliminary results of a compact color detecting and feedback system. The device is intended for use by those with vision-loss or disabilities who may benefit by a means of perceiving color. The device consists of a glove incorporating optical color sensors along with tactile switches affixed to the fingertips, a haptic feedback interface wrapped around the fore arm, and a microprocessor unit to control communication between sensing and feedback. The color data and finger selection is encoded to spatial and temporal parameters on tactors. The study extends on earlier investigations by Tapson et. al. that have successfully demonstrated the capability of accurately identifying colors through haptic feedback. To further extend the field, the present research attempts to characterize color information in a temporally and spatially continuous representation to more realistically …
