# Abstract
An arbitrated address-event imager has been designed and fabricated in a 0.6-/spl mu/m CMOS process. The imager is composed of 80 /spl times/ 60 pixels of 32 /spl times/ 30 /spl mu/m. The value of the light intensity collected by each photosensitive element is inversely proportional to the pixel's interspike time interval. The readout of each spike is initiated by the individual pixel; therefore, the available output bandwidth is allocated according to pixel output demand. This encoding of light intensities favors brighter pixels, equalizes the number of integrated photons across light intensity, and minimizes power consumption. Tests conducted on the imager showed a large output dynamic range of 180 dB (under bright local illumination) for an individual pixel. The array, on the other hand, produced a dynamic range of 120 dB (under uniform bright illumination and when no lower bound was placed on the update rate per …
