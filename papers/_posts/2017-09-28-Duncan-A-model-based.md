# Abstract
This paper proposes a model based approach to the development of a wireless biotelemetry communications system model that enables early architecture trades and optimization for safety, performance and power efficiency. This integrated system model is constructed using a model based engineering framework which enables the digital integration of requirements, architecture and disparate performance models to determine the optimal solution for an implanted communication system. In the conceptual and early design phases of a biotelemetry system one must consider the constraints of implanting devices in humans and animals, as well as those imposed on short range, high data rate wireless communications. This approach considers the effects of radio frequency performance, power dissipation, specific absorption rate (SAR), the implanted environment, propagation channel characteristics, data rates and also the receiver noise figure and sensitivity. The integrated model greatly improves the ability of the designer to quickly analyze hundreds or even thousands of trade studies while considering system requirements. The implementation of this model based framework was completed in 6 steps: requirements analysis and architecture development, identification of key performance parameters, system decomposition into functional building blocks and input/output definitions, analytical model creation, system model creation with models and validated data and finally, trade space simulation, analysis, visualization and optimization.
