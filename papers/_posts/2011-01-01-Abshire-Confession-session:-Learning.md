# Abstract
People rarely put in their papers the things that didn't work, the mistakes they made, and how they found out what went wrong. Such confessions can help others learn how to avoid similar mistakes. Twenty-six confessions were collected to form the bulk of this paper. Themes that arise are errors that result from not understanding the limitations of simulation tools in modeling physical reality, chip verification errors that result from lack of clear communication between designers, and projects that are considered in their own isolated environment of technical challenges rather than the broader context of their environment or application.
