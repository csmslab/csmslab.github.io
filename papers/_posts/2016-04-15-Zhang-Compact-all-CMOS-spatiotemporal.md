# Abstract
We present a low power all-CMOS implementation of temporal compressive sensing with pixel-wise coded exposure. This image sensor can increase video pixel resolution and frame rate simultaneously while reducing data readout speed. Compared to previous architectures, this system modulates pixel exposure at the individual photo-diode electronically without external optical components. Thus, the system provides reduction in size and power compare to previous optics based implementations. The prototype image sensor (127 × 90 pixels) can reconstruct 100 fps videos from coded images sampled at 5 fps. With 20× reduction in readout speed, our CMOS image sensor only consumes 14μW to provide 100 fps videos.
