# Abstract
A method for obtaining the optimal and specific sensor parameters for a tool-tip mountable ultrasonic transducer micro-array is presented. The ultrasonic transducer array sensor parameters, such as frequency of operation, element size, inter-element spacing, number of elements and transducer geometry are obtained using a quadratic programming method to obtain a maximum directivity while being constrained to a total array size of 4 mm2 and the required resolution for retinal imaging. The technique is used to design a uniformly spaced NN transducer array that is capable of resolving structures in the retina that are as small as 2 μm from a distance of 100 μm. The resultant 37 37 array of 16 μm transducers with 26 μm spacing will be realized as a Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer (CMUT) array and used for imaging and robotic guidance during retinal microsurgery.
