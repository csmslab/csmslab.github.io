# Abstract
Rhythmic motions of lower and upper limb prostheses for patients suffering from spinal cord injury (SCI) and amputees can be controlled and modulated using silicon neurons, designed in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) technology, that mimic pattern generation circuits found in the human spinal cord. Furthermore, synchronized patterns with arbitrarily phase delays, can easily be implemented using this technology. This allows locomotory gaits of any kind to be programmed in silico to control bipedal robotic locomotion. We argue that it is possible to use these circuits to control hand movements in prosthetic upper limbs using the same approach: the neuronsâ€™ oscillatory behavior can trigger rhythmic movements that can be started or stopped at any phase, thus enabling the production of discrete movements in upper limb prosthesis.
