# Abstract
We present an array of Mihalas-Niebur neurons with dynamically reconfigurable synapses implemented in 0.5 μm CMOS technology optimized for low-power, low-mismatch, and high-density. This neural array has two modes of operation: one is each cell in the array operates as independent leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, and the second is two cells work together to model the Mihalas-Niebur neuron dynamics. Depending on the mode of operation, this implementation consists of 2040 Mihalas-Niebur neurons or 4080 I&F neurons within a 3mm χ 3mm area. Each I&F neuron cell consumes an area of 1495μm2 and the neural array dissipates 360pJ of energy per synaptic event measured at 5.0V power supply (∼14pJ at 1.0V estimated from SPICE simulation).
