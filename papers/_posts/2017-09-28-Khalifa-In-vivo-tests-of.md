# Abstract
This work introduces the smallest wirelessly powered neural implant to date. We provide experiment verification by successfully stimulating the sciatic nerve of a rat. Power is deliverd over a 1.7 GHz inductive link at a distance of 0.5 cm. A method is also proposed to generate biphasic current pulses without the use of a controller. The entire system is fabricated in a 0.13 μm CMOS process and occupies merely 180 μm × 180 μm.
