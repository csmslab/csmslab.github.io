# Abstract
This work proposes solutions to the current bulky packaged neural implants. We describe the next generation of miniaturized wirelessly powered neural interface that are distributed and free floating in the nervous system. This paper focuses on the microassembly, hermetic packaging and its effect on the inductive power link.
