# Abstract
In limbed animals, spinal neural circuits responsible for controlling muscular activities during walking are called Central Pattern Generators (CPG). CPG networks display oscillatory activities that actuates individual or groups of muscles in a coordinated fashion so that the limbs of the animal are flexed and extended at the appropriate time and with the required velocity for the animal to efficiently traverse various types of terrain, and to recover from environmental perturbation. Typically, the CPG networks are constructed with many neurons, each of which has a number of control parameters. As the number of muscles increases, it is often impossible to manually, albeit intelligently, select the network parameters for a particular movement. Furthermore, it is virtually impossible to reconfigure the parameters on-line. This paper describes how Genetic Algorithms (GA) can be used for on-line (re) configuring of CPG networks for a bipedal robot. We show that the neuron parameters and connection weights/network topology of a canonical walking network can be reconfigured within a few of generations of the GA. The networks, constructed with Integrate-and-Fire-with-Adaptation (IFA) neurons, are implemented with a microcontroller and can be reconfigured to vary walking speed from 0.5 Hz to 3.5 Hz. The phase relationship between the hips and knees can be arbitrarily set (to within 1 degree) and prescribed complex joint angle profiles are realized. This is a powerful approach to generating complex muscle synergies for robots with multiple joints and distributed actuators.
