# Abstract
This paper examines how electrical stimulation of the spinal cord can modulate the output of the central pattern generator (CPG) for locomotion. Application of discrete current pulses to a single spinal segment was shown to affect multiple parameters of an ongoing locomotor pattern in an in vitro spinal cord. For any given stimulus, the effects on frequency, duration, and symmetry of locomotor output were strongly dependent on the phase at which stimulation was applied within the CPG cycle. Additionally, most stimuli had an immediate impact and evinced no effects on subsequent cycles. The most dramatic changes were seen when stimulation was applied during motor bursting: stimuli applied to the ipsilateral spinal hemicord increased the burst length, while stimuli applied to the contralateral spinal hemicord decreased the burst length. Smaller changes were observed when stimulating during delays between …
