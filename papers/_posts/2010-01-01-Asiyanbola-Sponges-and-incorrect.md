# Abstract
MethodsIRB approved retrospective review of our radiology database over 4-years (4/04-4/08) collecting demographic and radiologic data to determine the incidence and indication of X-rays performed for the purposes of detecting RFB.ResultsOf 13,335 portable abdominal x-rays taken, 203 were ordered to assess for RFB. There were 118M and 85F, mean age of 44 years. 28% of X-rays were taken due to no count (emergency), 28% were due to procedure or protocol and 25% due to incorrect instrument count. Only 19% were due to incorrect sponge count.
