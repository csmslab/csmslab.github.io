# Abstract
A proposed Locomotion Processing Unit (LPU) is described for generating stimulation patterns for restoring walking in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). The LPU operates using sensory and timing based control providing feed forward and feedback information. By breaking down different components of locomotion into states, the LPU activates different muscle groups, or synergies, to recreate the desired functional movements. The LPU circuitry was simulated and compared against another controller designed to restore locomotion in an anesthetized cat to validate its performance.
