# Abstract
In the generation or restoration of over-ground walking, the control strategy implemented is an important component to producing safe and stable movements. While the method of functional electrical stimulation (FES) needs to be able to generate sufficient forces and movements while not rapidly fatiguing the target muscles, it is also important that the stimulation produced uses suitable control strategies to adapt to environmental and internal perturbations. Previous work has demonstrated the efficacy of using open loop (feed forward) control, closed loop (feedback) control, or a combination of the two. In many cases, these controllers operate in a finite state space where transitions occur after certain timing rules or sensory rules activate. In particular, it has been demonstrated that IF-THEN rules can produce over-ground walking in cats through a finite state space. In this work, it is shown that algorithms involving neuron models can produce spike patterns which occur at a similar rate to those observed during in vivo production of over-ground walking. These results suggest that a neuromorphic controller could be implemented to produce such a control pattern while operating in a similar fashion to biology.
