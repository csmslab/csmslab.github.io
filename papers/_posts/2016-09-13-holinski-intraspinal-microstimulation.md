# Abstract
Objective. Spinal cord injury causes a drastic loss of motor, sensory and autonomic function. The goal of this project was to investigate the use of intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) for producing long distances of walking over ground. ISMS is an electrical stimulation method developed for restoring motor function by activating spinal networks below the level of an injury. It produces movements of the legs by stimulating the ventral horn of the lumbar enlargement using fine penetrating electrodes (≤50 μm diameter). Approach. In each of five adult cats (4.2–5.5 kg), ISMS was applied through 16 electrodes implanted with tips targeting lamina IX in the ventral horn bilaterally. A desktop system implemented a physiologically-based control strategy that delivered different stimulation patterns through groups of electrodes to evoke walking movements with appropriate limb kinematics and forces corresponding to swing and stance. Each cat walked over an instrumented 2.9 m walkway and limb kinematics and forces were recorded. Main results. Both propulsive and supportive forces were required for over-ground walking. Cumulative walking distances ranging from 609 to 835 m (longest tested) were achieved in three animals. In these three cats, the mean peak supportive force was 3.5 ± 0.6 N corresponding to full-weight-support of the hind legs, while the angular range of the hip, knee, and ankle joints were 23.1 ± 2.0°, 29.1 ± 0.2°, and 60.3 ± 5.2°, respectively. To further demonstrate the viability of ISMS for future clinical use, a prototype implantable module was successfully implemented in a subset of trials and produced comparable walking performance. Significance. By activating inherent locomotor networks within the lumbosacral spinal cord, ISMS was capable of producing bilaterally coordinated and functional over-ground walking with current amplitudes <100 μA. These exciting results suggest that ISMS may be an effective intervention for restoring functional walking after spinal cord injury.
