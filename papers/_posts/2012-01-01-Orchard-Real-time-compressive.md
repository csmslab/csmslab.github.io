# Abstract
Compressive sensing has allowed for reconstruction of missing pixels in incomplete images with higher accuracy than was previously possible. Moreover, video data or sequences of images contain even more correlation, leading to a much sparser representation as demonstrated repeatedly in numerous digital video formats and international standards. Compressive sensing has inspired the design of a number of imagers which take advantage of the need to only subsample a scene, which reduces power consumption by requiring acquisition and transmission of fewer samples. In this paper, we show how missing pixels in a video sequence can be estimated using compressive sensing techniques. We present a real time implementation of our algorithm and show its application to an asynchronous time-based image sensor (ATIS) from the Austrian Institute of Technology. The ATIS only provides pixel intensity data …
