# Abstract
BackgroundMore than 98% of intra-operative X-rays taken to search for postoperative retained foreign bodies (RFBs) have negative findings; in over 30% of cases of such X-rays, the finding is a false negative. Newer technologies created to find RFBs must not only reduce the false-negative rate, but also must not increase the burden of detecting RFBs. We have introduced the use of computer-aided detection (CAD) to facilitate the detection of RFBs on X-rays utilizing a modified version of map-seeking circuit (MSC) algorithm the referenced map-seeking circuit (RMSC), for our proof-of-concept study for detection of needles in plain abdominal X-rays.MethodsImages were obtained by using a portable cassette-based X-ray machine and a C-arm (digital) machine, both of which are commonly used in the operating room. The images obtained using these machines were divided into subimages of approximately 250 × …
