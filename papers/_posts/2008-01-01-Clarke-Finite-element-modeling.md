# Abstract
Tissue characterization using ultrasound scattering has been routinely used to extract the cellular properties of tissue. Ultrasonic backscattered radio frequency (RF) data is analyzed to provide estimates of the size, shape and concentration of a wide range of tissues. These tissue parameters form a feature space that can be used to discriminate between tissue types as well as indicate the presence of disease. In this work we develop numerical finite element models of tissue by using spectrum analysis to extract the acoustic properties of three distinct tissue-mimicking phantoms. The tissue-mimicking phantoms are constructed using glass microspheres of diameters 15–45 μm, 40–70 μm and 90–150 μm, embedded in a uniform concentration of gelatin derived from porcine skin. Spectrum analysis of the backscattered data from the tissue phantoms yields acoustic properties (of scatterer size, shape and distribution …
