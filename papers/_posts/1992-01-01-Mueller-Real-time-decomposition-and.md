# Abstract
A prototype programmable analog neural computer has been assembled from over 100 custom VLSI modules containing neurons, synapses, routing switches, and programmable synaptic time constants. The modules are directly interconnected and arbitrary network configurations can be programmed. Connection symmetry and modular construction allow expansion of the network to any size. The network runs in real time analog mode, but connection architecture as well as neuron and synapse parameters are controlled by a digital host. Network performance is monitored by the host through an A/D interface and used in the implementation of learning algorithms. The machine is intended for real time, real world computations. In its current configuration maximal speed is equivalent to that of a digital machine capable of 1011 FLOPS. The programmable synaptic time constants permit the real time computation of …
