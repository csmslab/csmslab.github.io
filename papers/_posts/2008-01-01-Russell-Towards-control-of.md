# Abstract
This work demonstrates how an in silico Pattern Generator (PG) can be used as a low power control system for rhythmic hand movements in an upper-limb prosthesis. Neural spike patterns, which encode rotation of a cylindrical object, were implemented in a custom Very Large Scale Integration chip. PG control was tested by using the decoded control signals to actuate the fingers of a virtual prosthetic arm. This system provides a framework for prototyping and controlling dexterous hand manipulation tasks in a compact and efficient solution.
