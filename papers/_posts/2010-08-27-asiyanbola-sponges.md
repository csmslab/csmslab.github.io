# Abstract
Postoperative retained foreign bodies \[RFB\] can be a serious event but are rare.The X-ray is the gold standard to detect RFB. Surgical sponges incorporating automatic data identity capture technology (radiofrequency tags, barcodes) have been proposed to detect RFB. In light of scarce resources in healthcare, careful consideration needs to be given to developing the right technology in order to maximize the process of elimination of RFB. We reviewed inciting events leading up to X-ray for detecting RFB.
