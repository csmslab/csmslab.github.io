# Abstract
128(H)/spl times/64(V)/spl times/RGB CMOS imager is integrated with region-of-interest selection, RGB-to-HSI transformation, HSI-based pixel segmentation, 36-bins/spl times/12b HSI histogramming, and sum-of-absolute-difference template matching. 32 learned color templates are stored and compared to each frame. At 30 frames/s, it uses 1 mW.
