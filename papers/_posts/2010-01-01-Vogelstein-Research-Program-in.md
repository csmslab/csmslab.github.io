# Abstract
JOHNS HOPKINS APL TECHNICAL DIGEST, VOLUME 28, NUMBER 3 (2010) 223 within the LOC are tuned to specific features of shape fragments (orientation, curvature, location, etc.). Tuning is apparent at the level of individual voxels or groups of voxels. A particular voxel pattern observed during visual perception of an image or visual imagery will correspond to a particular combination of shape fragments present in that image.
