# Abstract
The overall objective of this project is to develop a feedback-driven intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) system. Intraspinal microstimulation can be used to activate latent motor networks in the ventral horn of the spinal cord that remain intact below the lesion level after a traumatic spinal cord injury. Anesthetized cats were implanted with an ISMS electrode array, connected to a multichannel stimulator and control system. The system produced walking patterns in the hind legs while the front legs and torso were supported in a sling mounted on a cart. A 4-m instrumented walkway and motion analysis system were used to measure forces and kinematics. For the first time, we show, using low power stimulation of 16 electrodes, that sustainable, bilateral over/-ground walking can be reliably obtained in cats for distances exceeding those obtained with other forms of functional electrical stimulation in acute experiments. For the purpose of this paper, the results of an individual cat will be presented to demonstrate the efficacy of this stimulation method. Peak ground clearance averaged 11.5 mm and peak supportive forces averaged 2.44 N per leg over 821 m of walking. In addition, we produced similar in vivo results in the same experimental setup using a miniaturization of these technologies into a single integrated circuit, which could eventually become part of an implanted system.
