# Abstract
We discuss vibration control of a cantilevered plate with multiple sensors and actuators. An architecture is chosen to minimize the number of control and sensing wires required. A custom VLSI chip, integrated with the sensor/actuator elements, controls the local behavior of the plate. All the actuators are addressed in parallel; local decode logic selects which actuator is stimulated. Downloaded binary data controls the applied voltage and modulation frequency for each actuator, and High Voltage MOSFETs are used to activate them. The sensors, which are independent adjacent piezoelectric ceramic elements, can be accessed in a random or sequential manner. An A/D card and GPIB interconnected test equipment allow a PC to read the sensors' outputs and dictate the actuation procedure. A visual programming environment is used to integrate the sensors, controller and actuators. Based on the constitutive relations …
