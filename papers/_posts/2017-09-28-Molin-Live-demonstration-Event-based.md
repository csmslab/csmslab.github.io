# Abstract
Neuromorphic systems mimic the functionality and communication protocol of biological neurons with efforts to design the most size and power efficient computing systems. We demonstrate the capability of an in-house neural array of 4080 Mihalas-Niebur neurons designed in 0.5Î¼m CMOS technology to perform various event-based image processing tasks including warping and filtering.
