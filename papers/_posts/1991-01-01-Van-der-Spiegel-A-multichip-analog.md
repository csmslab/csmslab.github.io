# Abstract
A multichip, programmable analog neural network for real-time dynamic computations is described. The network's interconnection structure, the neuron characteristics, synaptic connections, and synaptic time constant are modifiable. The chips are designed to allow a modular and expandable gross architecture that can be adjusted to the complexity of the task. The network operates fully analog in real time. However, a digital host is used to set the network parameters and monitor the neuron outputs. A prototype neural computer consisting of 72 neurons has been assembled and tested. The network has been successfully configured for several applications and found to have a performance that is equivalent to a digital machine of 10/sup 11/ FLOPS.
