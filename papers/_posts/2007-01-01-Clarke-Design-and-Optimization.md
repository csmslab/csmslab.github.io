# Abstract
The design of a tool-tip mounted cMUT (capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer) micro-array for near field imaging of the retina is undertaken. For intra-vitreal applications, a uniformly excited NtimesN transducer array is limited to a size of 2mm times 2mm. The physical parameters of the array are constrained by the imaging requirements of a 2 mum resolution and a distance of 400 mum from the retinal surface. The mechanical and electrical parameters of the cMUT are calculated using a combination of the Mason equivalent circuit model and finite element techniques. Optimal transmit power and receive sensitivity for this imaging application are obtained by coupling the transducer model to a pseudo-spectral wave propagation model. The pseudo-spectral method is used to calculate the frequency dependent attenuation of the transmitted acoustic pulse through the vitreous and retinal media. The …
