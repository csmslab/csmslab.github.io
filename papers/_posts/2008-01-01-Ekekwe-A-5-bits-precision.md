# Abstract
This paper presents the design and implementation of a high precision CMOS bandgap voltage reference. It uses an on-chip 5-bits bi-directional trimming array with 32 voltage levels to achieve process variations and temperature independence. The digitally programmable array is binary weighted for accuracy and flexibility. Implemented in a 0.5μm 2P3M CMOS process, it consumes a total power of 7.2mW and takes an active area of 0.024 mm2. Through trimming, the voltage temperature dependence was reduced from 102 ppm/°C to 6.2 ppm/°C within the temperature range of 10°C to 50°C.
