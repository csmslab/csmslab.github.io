# Abstract
 Traditional approaches for solving real-world problems using computer vision have depended heavily on CCD cameras and workstations. As the computation power of workstations doubles every 1.5 years, they are now better able to handle the large amount of data presented by the cameras; yet real-time solutions for physical interaction with the real-world continues to be very hard, and relegated to large and expensive systems. Our approach attempts to solve this problem by using computational sensors and small/inexpensive embedded processors. The computational sensors are custom designed to reduce the amount of data collected, to extract only relevant information and to present this information to the simple processor, microcontrollers (μCs) or DSPs, in a format which reduces post-processing latency. Consequently, the post-processors are required to perform only high level computation on …
