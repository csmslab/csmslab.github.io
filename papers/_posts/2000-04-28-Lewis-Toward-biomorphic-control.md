# Abstract
The locomotor controller for walking, running, swimming, and flying animals is based on a central pattern generator (CPG). Models of CPGs as systems of coupled nonlinear oscillators have been proposed and have been used for the control of robots. In this paper we describe the implementation of an adaptive CPG model in a compact, custom analog VLSI circuit. We demonstrate the function of the chip by controlling an underactuated, running robotic leg. This circuit has adaptive properties that allow it to tune its behavior based on sensory feedback. To our knowledge this is the first instance of an adaptive CPG chip. This approach supports the construction of extremely inexpensive, low power and compact controllers for walking, flying and swimming machines.
