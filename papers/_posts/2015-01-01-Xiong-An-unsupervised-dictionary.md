# Abstract
To meet the growing demand of wireless and power efficient neural recordings systems, we demonstrate an unsupervised dictionary learning algorithm in Compressed Sensing (CS) framework which can be implemented in VLSI systems. Without prior label information of neural spikes, we extend our previous work to unsupervised learning and construct a dictionary with discriminative structures for spike sorting. To further improve the reconstruction and classification performance, we proposed a joint prediction to determine the class of neural spikes in dictionary learning. When the neural spikes is compressed 50 times, our approach can achieve an average gain of 2 dB and 15 percentage units over state-of-the-art of CS approaches in terms of the reconstruction quality and classification accuracy respectively.
