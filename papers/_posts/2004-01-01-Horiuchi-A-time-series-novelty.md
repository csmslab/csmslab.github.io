# Abstract
International Journal of Robotics and Automation, Vol. 19, No. ?, 2004 A TIME-SERIES NOVELTY 
DETECTION CHIP FOR SONAR TK Horiuchi∗ and R. Etienne-Cummings∗∗ Abstract A 
time-series processor chip, intended for sonar mapping and novelty detection applications, has 
been designed, fabricated, and tested. The chip, when coupled with an external sonar bearing 
estimation unit, receives an image of the sonar environment as a voltage waveform. The bearing 
of an object is given to the chip by the magnitude of the voltage, and its range is given by the 
time following the transmission of the sonar “ping. The chip stores this voltage waveform in a 
bank of sample-and-hold (S/H) elements and compares it to a previously stored trace. Objects 
(echo returns) that move in either azimuth or range are immediately detected and reported. The 
chip contains 54 S/H and detector elements that are sequentially triggered by an …
