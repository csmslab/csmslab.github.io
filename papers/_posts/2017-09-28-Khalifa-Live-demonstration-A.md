# Abstract
The smallest wirelessly powered neural implant to date is demonstrated. Power is sent over a near-field inductive link. The implant system is realized on a single CMOS ASIC which includes the on-chip coil, the harvesting circuit, and the current driver. The entire system is fabricated in a 0.13 μm CMOS process and occupies merely 180 μm × 180 μm.
