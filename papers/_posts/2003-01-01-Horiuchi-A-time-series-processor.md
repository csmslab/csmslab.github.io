# Abstract
A time-series processor chip, intended for sonar mapping and novelty detection applications, has been designed, fabricated and tested. The chip, when coupled with a sonar bearing and range estimation unit, receives an image of the environment as a voltage waveform. The bearing of an object is given by the magnitude of the signal, while its range is given by its time following the transmission of the sonar 'ping'. The chip stores this voltage waveform in a bank of sample-and-hold (S/H) elements and compares it to a previously stored trace. Objects that move in either azimuth or range are immediately detected and reported. The chip contains 54 S/H elements that are triggered by an on-board timer. The change detector can detect motion in bearing and range of 10 degrees/s and 11 cm/s, respectively. The maximum range is approximately 5 m. Operating in the CMOS subthreshold region of operation, the novelty …
