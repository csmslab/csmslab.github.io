pkaz@jhu.edu ABSTRACT Mathematical models and simulation results are presented for a VLSI 
chip being designed to control a 34-axis robot intended for minimally invasive throat surgery. 
The chip, in concert with control algorithms executed on a supervisory microprocessor, will deliver 
appropriate control voltages to the motors to guide the end effectors of the robot, while compensating 
for changes in resistance to motion as the robot interacts with tissue. The control signals both 
generated on-chip and from the microprocessor, are conditioned and presented to the …
