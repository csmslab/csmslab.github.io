# Abstract
Objective. Spinal cord injury causes a drastic loss of motor, sensory and autonomic function. The goal of this project was to investigate the use of intraspinal microstimulation (ISMS) for producing long distances of walking over ground. ISMS is an electrical stimulation method developed for restoring motor function by activating spinal networks below the level of an injury. It produces movements of the legs by stimulating the ventral horn of the lumbar enlargement using fine penetrating electrodes (≤ 50 μm diameter). Approach. In each of five adult cats (4.2–5.5 kg), ISMS was applied through 16 electrodes implanted with tips targeting lamina IX in the ventral horn bilaterally. A desktop system implemented a physiologically-based control strategy that delivered different stimulation patterns through groups of electrodes to evoke walking movements with appropriate limb kinematics and forces corresponding to swing and …
