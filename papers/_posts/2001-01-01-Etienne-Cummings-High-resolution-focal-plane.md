# Abstract
Two types of focal plane image processing chips are presented. They address the two extremes of the application spectrum: general purpose and application specific designs. They both exploit the promise of focal-plane computation offered by CMOS technology. The general-purpose computational sensor, a 16x16 pixels prototype (easily scalable to larger arrays), has been fabricated in a standard 1.2 μ CMOS process, and its spatio-temporal filtering capabilities have been successfully tested. An array larger than 300x300 array will use only 0.5% of the chip area for the processing unit while providing multiple spatio-temporally processed images in parallel. The 16x16 chip performs 1 GOPS/mW (5.5-bit scale-accumulate) while computing four spatio-temporal images in parallel. The application specific system realizes a hybrid imaging system by combining a 120 X 36 low-noise active pixel sensor (APS) array with …
