# Abstract
 Visual motion detection is a fundament component of vision, and plays a vital role in scene analysis and understanding for behaving organisms. In computer vision, motion detection requires considerable resources to obtain real-time results. Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) technology offers a convenient substrate upon which both photosensitive elements and motion extracting circuits can be implemented, thus allowing real-time motion detection. This paper presents two approaches for implementing real-time visual motion detection in VLSI. The two approaches mimic the two primary methods found in biological organisms. Insect motion detection employs local correlation and is implemented very close to the photoreceptors. In contrast, primate motion detection is performed in cortex, using spatiotemporally oriented neural filters. The analysis, construction and results of the hardware models of insect …
