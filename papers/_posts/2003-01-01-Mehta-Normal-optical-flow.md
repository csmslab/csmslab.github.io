# Abstract
This paper introduces a 2-D dense Normal Optical Flow estimation algorithm being implemented in VLSI which combines imaging and processing on the same chip efficiently. The algorithm computes partial derivatives with respect to time and space and uses their ratio to compute normal flow velocity. The chip implemented in 0.5/spl mu/m CMOS process has a 92/spl times/52 array of APS pixels. The chip occupies an area of 4.5 mm/sup 2/.
