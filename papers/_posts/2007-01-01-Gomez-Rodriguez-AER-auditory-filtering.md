# Abstract
Address-event-representation (AER) is a communication protocol for transferring asynchronous events between VLSI chips, originally developed for bio-inspired processing systems (for example, image processing). The event information in an AER system is transferred using a high-speed digital parallel bus. This paper presents an experiment using AER for sensing, processing and finally actuating a robot. The AER output of a silicon cochlea is processed by an AER filter implemented on a FPGA to produce rhythmic walking in a humanoid robot (Redbot). We have implemented both the AER rhythm detector and the central pattern generator (CPG) on a Spartan II FPGA which is part of a USB-AER platform developed by some of the authors
