# Abstract
This paper introduces a synchronous current rectifier designed for use in large-scale current-mode analog integrated circuits. The circuit was optimized for use in synchronous current-mode systems requiring a large number of rectifiers. The proposed rectifier is compared to several continuous time current-mode rectifiers, demonstrating a very low power (<1/spl mu/W) operation while achieving high operating speeds (<20ns decision + settling time for /spl plusmn/10/spl mu/A inputs).
