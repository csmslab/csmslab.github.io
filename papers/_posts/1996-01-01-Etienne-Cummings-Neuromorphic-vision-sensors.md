# Abstract
A review of current trends in biologically based computational visual sensors, also known as neuromorphic sensors, is presented. Neuromorphic sensors attempt to mimic the sensing and early visual-processing characteristics of living organisms. The objective of these sensors is to help reduce the computational load required for visual perception by extracting only information relevant to the post-processing stages. Furthermore, mechanisms for improving electronic imaging are also obtained by mimicking their biological counterparts. This paper provides the history and current practices for implementing neuromorphic sensors with (1) task-specific spatial variant layouts, (2) continuous time and steady-state phototransduction, (3) dynamic range compression using logarithmic and adaptive photoreceptors, and (4) early visual processing capabilities for focal plane edge, motion and orientation detection. For each of …
