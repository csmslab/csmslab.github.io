# Abstract
An 80 x 60 pixels arbitrated address-event imager has been designed and fabricated in a O. 6p. m CMOS process. The value of the intensity is inversely proportional to the inter-spike interval and the read-out of each spike is initiated by the pixel. The available output bandwidth is allocated according to the pixels demand, favoring brighter pixels and minimizing power consumption. The imager has a large dynamic range: 200dB for an individual pixel. The array has a dynamic range of l20dB. The power consumption is 3.4 mW in uniform indoor light and a mean event rate of 200K]-lz (41.7 effective fps). The imager is capable of 8.3 K effective fps.
