# Abstract
The application of a general purpose analog neural computer (GPANC) and a smart silicon retina to target recognition, acquisition and tracking is discussed. The GPANC is designed as a general purpose tool for the implementation of real time neural based solutions to real world problems. It is composed of modules which mimic biological neurons, synapses and axon/dendrites. The modules are fully programmable and are arranged in macro cells to facilitate gross expansion of the computer. The presented version is composed of 10/sup 3/ neurons, 10/sup 5/ synapses, 10/sup 4/ synaptic time constants and 6 /spl times/ 10/sup 5/ interconnection switches. Its computation rate is 10/sup 11/ CPS or it can solve 10/sup 3/ nonlinear functions of 10/sup 4/ coupled first order differential equations in real time. Except for a digital host for programming the GPANC, it operates in full continuous time analog mode and offers …
