# Abstract
A method for obtaining the optimal and specific sensor parameters for an ultrasonic transducer micro‐array is presented. The ultrasonic transducer array sensor parameters, such as frequency of operation, element size, interelement spacing, number of elements, and transducer geometry, are adjusted using a quadratic programming method to obtain maximum directivity while being constrained by MEMS design rules, a total array size of 4 mm2, and the required resolution for microsurgery. The technique is used to determine whether a uniformly spaced N×N transducer array is capable of resolving structures as small as 2 μm. The parameters extracted from the proposed technique will be used in the development of tool‐mounted sensors for imaging and robotic guidance for retinal microsurgery.
