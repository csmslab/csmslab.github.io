# Abstract
2-D displays present significant visualization deficits and can hinder task performance when accurate perception of depth is required. Navigation of rugged terrain, scouting, and object detection at a distance all present limitations when viewed on traditional 2-D displays. The current investigation presents a novel use of stereo and hyperstereo image pairs to create a 3-D representation of the visual scene. Use of the stereo base pair provides natural depth perception for near-field viewing, while hyperstereo image pairs augment natural depth acuity for distant scenes.
