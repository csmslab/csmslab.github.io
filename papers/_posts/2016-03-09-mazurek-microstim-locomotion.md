# Abstract
Neural pathways can be artificially activated through the use of electrical stimulation. For individuals with a spinal cord injury, intraspinal microstimulation, using electrical currents on the order of 125 μA, can produce muscle contractions and joint torques in the lower extremities suitable for restoring walking. The work presented here demonstrates an integrated circuit implementing a state-based control strategy where sensory feedback and intrinsic feed forward control shape the stimulation waveforms produced on-chip. Fabricated in a 0.5 μm process, the device was successfully used in vivo to produce walking movements in a model of spinal cord injury. This work represents progress towards an implantable solution to be used for restoring walking in individuals with spinal cord injuries.
