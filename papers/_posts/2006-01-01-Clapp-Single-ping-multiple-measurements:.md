# Abstract
Presented is a mixed-signal full-custom VLSI chip designed to receive sonar return signals from an ultrasonic microphone array, and extract input bearing angles of the incoming signals. Processing utilizes simple low-power analog spatiotemporal bandpass filters to extract wavefront velocity across the array, which translates to input bearing angle. Processing uses phase information of array signals, not onset or offset of ultrasonic burst. With such synchronous processing, multiple angle readings from different returns of the same ultrasonic transmit burst are possible. Compatible microphone arrays are compact in size-test array has a total baseline of 26.5 mm. In a test with ultrasonic beacon 65 cm from a microphone array, angular precision of 1/spl deg/ was demonstrated in most instances in the range -60/spl deg/ to 60/spl deg/. Applications include sonar localization of remote objects, sonar imaging, and improved …
