# Abstract
Recently, CMOS image sensors have attracted more and more attention from the applications of navigation, monitoring and search-and-rescue operations. Specially, CMOS image sensors mounted on insects need to be fast, adaptive to the environment and power efficiency. To simultaneously satisfy both requirements of reconstruction quality and low power consumption, we propose a compressed sensing block-wise exposure control algorithm using optical flow estimation. This framework has been demonstrated to further improve recovery performance (> 25 dB) with high compression ratio (>= 10 : 1), which also provides a promising method for real-time CMOS implementation.
