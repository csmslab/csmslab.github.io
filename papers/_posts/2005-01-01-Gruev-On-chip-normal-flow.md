# Abstract
Extracting relevant visual information about the operating environment of a roving robot at the focal plane is a challenging problem.  We present two image processing architectures for motion computation at the focal plane.  The first imaging architecture, composed of 250 x 250 active pixel sensors, has spatiotemporal difference computation capabilities at the focal plane.  This spatiotemporal difference imager, fabricated in a 0.35μ process, contains in-pixel storage elements for previous and current frames and difference computational units outside the imaging array. A novel scan out technique allows for parallel computation of spatial and temporal 1-D derivatives on the read out. The final motion estimation based on the image brightness constancy equation, which is approximated as the ratio of the temporal and spatial derivates, is computed off chip, but it can be easily implemented on-chip.  This approach can …
