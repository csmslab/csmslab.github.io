# Abstract
We present a bidirectional neural interface with a 4-channel biopotential analog-to-digital converter (bioADC) and a 4-channel current-mode stimulator in 180 nm CMOS. The bioADC directly transduces microvolt biopotentials into a digital representation without a voltage-amplification stage. Each bioADC channel comprises a continuous-time first-order ΔΣ modulator with a chopper-stabilized OTA input and current feedback, followed by a second-order comb-filter decimator with programmable oversampling ratio. Each stimulator channel contains two independent digital-to-analog converters for anodic and cathodic current generation. A shared calibration circuit matches the amplitude of the anodic and cathodic currents for charge balancing. Powered from a 1.5 V supply, the analog and digital circuits in each recording channel draw on average 1.54 μA and 2.13 μA of supply current, respectively. The bioADCs …
