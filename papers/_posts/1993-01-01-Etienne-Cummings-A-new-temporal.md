# Abstract
A new temporal domain technique for optical flow measurement is presented. This approach, which has been developed primarily for VLSI implementation, requires only the sign of spatiotemporal derivatives, 1-b Boolean multiplication and integer arithmetic to compute image velocity. Hence, it can be easily and efficiently implemented in hardware and software. It is composed of a hybrid of the Reichardt and Ullman-Marr motion models and measures both speed and direction at every pixel. For image sequences, it measures the number of frames required for an edge to translate over a pixel, while in analog hardware, it measures the time. Direction is given by correlating the disappearance of an edge at one pixel with its reappearance at a neighboring pixel. A test chip of this scheme has been implemented in 2 /spl mu/m VLSI and was found to measure 2-D velocity over three orders of magnitude. A total of 0.1 mW …
