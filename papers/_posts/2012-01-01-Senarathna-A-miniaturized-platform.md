# Abstract
Imaging the brain in animal models enables scientists to unravel new biological insights. Despite critical advancements in recent years, most laboratory imaging techniques comprise of bulky bench top apparatus that require the imaged animals to be anesthetized and immobilized. Thus, animals are imaged in their non-native state severely restricting the scope of behavioral experiments. To address this gap, we report a miniaturized microscope that can be mounted on a rat's head for imaging in awake and unrestrained conditions. The microscope uses laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), a high resolution yet wide field imaging modality for imaging blood vessels and perfusion. Design details of both the image formation and acquisition modules are presented. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the depth of tissue penetration achievable by the imaging system while the produced speckle Airy disc …
