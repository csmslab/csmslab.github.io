# Abstract
Our visual system deals with a three-dimensional space but most of the current saliency models do not include depth information. We extend a proto-object based model to show how stereoscopic depth perception changes the ability to predict saliency on natural scenes. Results show the ability to mark depth discontinuities and a promising statistical improvement.
