# Abstract
This paper describes an impulse-based ultra wideband (I-UWB) transmitter suitable for bio-implantable applications requiring high data rate transmission. A fully digital transmitter is implemented in a 65 nm CMOS technology, with measures taken to address reliability and process variation considerations. A low-complexity ring oscillator-based pulse generator architecture is adopted for increased power efficiency and minimal silicon area. The transmitter occupies 68 × 68 μm2 of silicon area, consumes 0.72 μW static power and achieves an energy efficiency of 19 pJ/pulse at 200 MHz pulse repetition frequency.
