# Abstract
 Despite the huge research effort to improve the performance of the complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors, charge-coupled devices (CCDs) still dominate the cell biology-related conventional fluorescence microscopic imaging market where low or ultra-low noise imaging is required. A detailed comparison of the sensor specifications and performance is usually not provided by the manufacturers which leads the end users not to go out of the habitude and choose a CCD camera instead of a CMOS one. However, depending on the application, CMOS cameras, when empowered by image processing algorithms, can become cost-efficient solutions for conventional fluorescence microscopy. In this paper, we introduce an application-based comparative study between the default CCD camera of an inverted microscope (Nikon Ti-S Eclipse) and a custom-designed CMOS camera and …
