# Abstract
This paper summarizes the application of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) to the development of a system trade study and decision-making tool for implantable ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless biotelemetry communications systems. The systems modeling language (SysML) is used to develop graphical representations, called descriptive models, of the system architecture, parameters, and interdependencies along with leveraging various analytical tools to produce performance and safety assessments of various system configurations. Both descriptive and analytical models are linked together to enable system designers the ability to rapidly run a wide range of system configurations such that the results can be visualized, analyzed, and pruned to meet system safety and performance requirements. This integrated system approach is more effective than typical standalone or disparate analysis since it …
