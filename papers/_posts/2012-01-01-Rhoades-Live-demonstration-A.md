# Abstract
This proposed demonstration utilizes a color glove which senses RGB values from optical sensors on four fingertips and maps them to an array of motors attached to a wearable vest. The aim of this project is to map the visual world to a tactile representation which enables the user's perception of color through the appropriate activation of motors around the torso. The long term goal of this project is create a device in which individuals who are visually impaired can perceive the colors of the physical world through touch.
