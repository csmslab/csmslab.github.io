# Abstract
A second-generation stereo vision chip, fabricated in a 0.35mum 4M2P CMOS process and incorporating two 128 times 128 pixel linear current-mode imagers and current-mode disparity computation circuitry, is presented. Parallel computation of the sum-of-absolute-difference matching metric allows the chip to produce 114 times 124 pixel depth maps at 30 frames per second, performing 2.2 billion operations per second, while using 10.1mA from a 3.3V supply
