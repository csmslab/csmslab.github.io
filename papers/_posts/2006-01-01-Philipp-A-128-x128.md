# Abstract
A single-chip stereo imager incorporates two 128times128 linear current-mode active pixel sensors with 10mum pixel pitch and 1.2% uncorrected FPN. The chip, fabricated in a 0.35mum 3.3V 4M2P CMOS process, uses parallel computation of the sum-of-absolute-difference matching metric and confidence measures to produce 114times125 depth maps at 30frames/s using 33mW from 3.3V
