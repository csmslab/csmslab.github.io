# Abstract
A second generation 80/spl times/60 pixels arbitrated address-event imager has been designed and fabricated in a 0.6 /spl mu/m CMOS process. Its pixel has been improved for image quality, power consumption and dynamic range. The improved pixel dynamic range is 203 dB. The array has a dynamic range of 119 dB. The power consumption is 1.7 mW in uniform indoor light and a mean event rate of 142 K events/s (2.8 K effective fps). The imager is capable of updating its images 10.4 K times/s.
