# Abstract
This paper proposes a model based approach to the development of a wireless biotelemetry communications system model that enables early architecture trades and optimization for safety, performance and power efficiency. This integrated system model is constructed using a model based engineering framework which enables the digital integration of requirements, architecture and disparate performance models to determine the optimal solution for an implanted communication system. In the conceptual and early design phases of a biotelemetry system one must consider the constraints of implanting devices in humans and animals, as well as those imposed on short range, high data rate wireless communications. This approach considers the effects of radio frequency performance, power dissipation, specific absorption rate (SAR), the implanted environment, propagation channel characteristics, data rates and …
