# Abstract
Autonomous aerial vehicles perofrming visual tasks must operate under low-power, small-size, and light-weight constraints. We demonstrate an event-based dewarping task using a neuromorphic camera and processor for efficiently performing this visual task for a mobile quadcopter in real-time.
