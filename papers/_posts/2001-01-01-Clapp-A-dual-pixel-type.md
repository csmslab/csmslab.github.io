# Abstract
An imager chip has been designed, fabricated, and tested having two unique pixel types interleaved on the same array. The dual-pixel design enables optimization for two separate tasks. One type of pixel is an Active Pixel Sensor (APS), which is used to produce a low-noise image. The other type is a custom-designed pixel optimized for computing the centroid of a moving object in the scene. The APS array is 120 columns/spl times/36 rows, with a pixel size of 14.7 /spl mu/m/spl times/14.7 /spl mu/m. The centroid array has 60 columns and 36 rows, with a larger pixel size of 29.4 /spl mu/m/spl times/29.4 /spl mu/m. The chip was fabricated using standard scalable rules on a 0.7 /spl mu/m CMOS process, with one polysilicon layer, 3 metal layers, and a linear capacitor layer. APS images were taken at a frame rate of 30 fps, and centroid data was taken at a rate of 180 (x,y) coordinates per second. The chip consumed 3 …
