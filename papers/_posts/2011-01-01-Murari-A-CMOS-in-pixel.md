# Abstract
Traditionally, charge-coupled device (CCD)-based image sensors have held sway over the field of biomedical imaging. Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-based imagers so far lack sensitivity leading to poor low-light imaging. Certain applications including our work on animal-mountable systems for imaging in awake and unrestrained rodents require the high sensitivity and image quality of CCDs and the low power consumption, flexibility, and compactness of CMOS imagers. We present a 132 × 124 high sensitivity imager array with a 20.1-μ m pixel pitch fabricated in a standard 0.5- μm CMOS process. The chip incorporates n-well/p-sub photodiodes, capacitive transimpedance amplifier (CTIA)-based in-pixel amplification, pixel scanners, and delta differencing circuits. The 5-transistor all-nMOS pixel interfaces with peripheral pMOS transistors for column-parallel CTIA. At 70 frames/s, the array has …
