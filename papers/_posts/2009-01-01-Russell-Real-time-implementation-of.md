# Abstract
In order for the functionality of an upper-limb prosthesis to approach that of a real limb it must be able to, accurately and intuitively, convey sensory feedback to the limb user. This paper presents results of the real-time implementation of a ‘biofidelic’ model that describes mechanotransduction in Slowly Adapting Type 1 (SA1) afferent fibers. The model accurately predicts the timing of action potentials for arbitrary force or displacement stimuli and its output can be used as stimulation times for peripheral nerve stimulation by a neuroprosthetic device. The model performance was verified by comparing the predicted action potential (or spike) outputs against measured spike outputs for different vibratory stimuli. Furthermore experiments were conducted to show that, like real SA1 fibers, the model's spike rate varies according to input pressure and that a periodic ‘tapping’ stimulus evokes periodic spike outputs.
