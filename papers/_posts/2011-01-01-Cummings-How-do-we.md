# Abstract
It is postulated that future brain-machine interfaces (BMI) will not only be used to infer the host's intentions from brain activities or to provide the host with extrinsic information but may provide extensions, enhancements and replacement of parts of the brain itself. Applications of BMI are clearly in the realm of science fiction at this point and time, however, progress is being made to model and mimick parts of the brain so that we are getting closer to making these dreams a reality.We assert that such BMI devices will not be truly realized until the electronics "speak the same language" as the biological brain. That is, the signaling interface between the electronic and biological systems must match and the computation performed by the electronic device must also be implemented similarly to biological computation.
