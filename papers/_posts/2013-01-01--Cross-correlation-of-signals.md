# Abstract
A sub-circuit for facilitating the synchronization of event-based samples of signals in a cross-correlation circuit utilizing event-based sampling is provided. The sub-circuit alternatively integrates one of the signals to be cross-correlated and alternates between the signals in response to the output of a hysteretic comparator. The invention extends to a method of manipulating the input signals to a cross-correlation circuit utilizing event-based sampling so-as to facilitate the synchronization of the event-based samples of the signals.
