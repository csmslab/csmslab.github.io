# Abstract
A compact all-CMOS spatiotemporal compressed sensing (CS) video camera is demonstrated. This CS-based framework, implemented on integrated circuits, is able to achieve 20-fold reduction in the readout speed and consumes only 14μW to provide 100 fps videos. Taking advantage of dictionary learning and sparse recovery, this prototype image sensor (127×90 pixels) can reconstruct 100 fps videos from the coded images sampled at 5 fps.
