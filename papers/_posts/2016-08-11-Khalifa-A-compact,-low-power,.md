# Abstract
This paper describes a miniaturized inductively powered neural stimulator chip. We propose a solution to overcome the bulkiness of present neural implants by eliminating the need for data decoders, digital control blocks and clocks. This approach trades-off programmability, such as precise stimulus amplitude control, for a considerable reduction in chip area and power consumption. The system is fabricated in a 0.18 μm CMOS process, consumes about 16 μW and occupies merely 220 μm × 180 μm.
