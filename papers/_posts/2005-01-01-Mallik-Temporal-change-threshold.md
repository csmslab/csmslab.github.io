# Abstract
A 90/spl times/90 active pixel sensor (APS) achieves 2% in-pixel change/motion detection at 30f/s consuming 4.2mW. The 6T2C 25/spl mu/m /spl times/ 25 /spl mu/m pixel in 0.5 /spl mu/m 2P3M CMOS provides intensity readout, detection of change events and polarities. Event address and APS value output are asynchronous, facilitating compression. The imager is intended for low-power low-bandwidth surveillance network applications.
