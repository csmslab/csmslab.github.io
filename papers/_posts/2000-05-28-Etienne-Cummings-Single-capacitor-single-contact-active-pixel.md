# Abstract
An 86(H)/spl times/75(V) Active Pixel Sensor (APS) using a single-capacitor-single-contact pixel, in a BiCMOS process, is presented. The cell size is 14/spl lambda//spl times/14/spl lambda/, using MOSIS' SCMOS design rules. A smaller cell size is possible in non-scalable processes. The pixel is composed of an NPN phototransistor with a floating base; the base is capacitively coupled to the column select line. A large fill factor, for a CMOS APS, of 76.5% is obtained. With an integration time of 27.68 /spl mu/s, pixel sensitivity is 6.2 nA/lux and does not saturate above 8 K lux. The reset scheme provides simultaneous lag and blooming protection at 75 frames/s.
