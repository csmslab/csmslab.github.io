Congratulations to [Adam Khalifa][1] for successfully defending his dissertation, __Design, Fabrication and Validation of a Highly Miniaturized Wirelessly Powered Neural Implant__. He's headed to Harvard next for his post-doctoral work.

Read the abstract of his dissertation below:

> We have recently witnessed an explosion in the number of neurons that can be recorded and/or stimulated simultaneously during neurophysiological experiments. Experiments have progressed from recording or stimulation with a single electrode to Micro-Electrode Array (MEA) such as the Utah Array. These MEAs can be instrumented with current drivers, neural amplifiers, digitizers and wireless communication links. The broad interest in these MEAs suggests that there is a need for large scale neural recording and stimulation. The ultimate goal is to coordinate the recordings and stimulation of potentially millions of neurons from many brain areas. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art MEAs are limited by their scalability and long-term stability because of their physical size and rigid configuration. Furthermore, some applications prioritize a distributed neural interface over one that offers high resolution. Examples of biomedical applications that necessitate an interface with neurons from many sites in the brain include: i) understanding and treating neurological disorders that affect distributed locations throughout the CNS; ii) revolutionizing our understanding of the brain by studying the correlations between neural networks from different regions of the brain and the mechanisms of cognitive functions; and iii) covering larger area in the sensorimotor cortex of amputees to more accurately control robotic prosthetic limbs or better evoke a sense of touch.

> One solution to make large scale, fully specifiable, electrical stimulation and recording possible, is to disconnect the electrodes from the base, so that they can be arbitrarily placed, using a syringe, freely in the nervous system. To overcome the miniaturization challenges, we propose the “microbead”, an ultra-small neural stimulation, that is currently implemented in a 130nm CMOS technology with the following characteristics: 200 mm × 200 mm × 100 mm size; optimized wireless powering, all micro-electronics on single chip; and integrated electrodes and coil . The stimulating microbead is validated in a sciatic nerve by generating leg movements. A recording microbead is also investigated with following characteristics: wireless powering using steerable phased coil array, miniaturized front-end, and backscattering telemetry. These microbeads could eventually replace the rigid arrays that are currently the state-of-the-art in electrophysiology set-ups.
