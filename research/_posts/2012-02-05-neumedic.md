blurb: Investigating new bioelectronic approaches to pancreatic stimulation for diabetes control.

Diabetes is a disease caused by a breakdown in the glucose metabolic process resulting in abnormal blood glucose fluctuations. Traditionally, control has involved external insulin injection in response to elevated blood glucose to substitute the role of the beta cells in the pancreas, which would otherwise perform this function in a healthy individual. The central nervous system (CNS), however, also plays a vital role in glucose homoeostasis through the control of pancreatic secretion and insulin sensitivity which could potentially be used as a pathway for enhancing glucose control. Within this context, a novel emerging field called bioelectronic medicine, which relies on electrical modulation of the neural signals to the organs, has been introduced as an alternative treatment to using pharmaceuticals. Furthering this new emerging field, NeuMeDiC aims at studying whether there is potential benefit of interfacing with the neural pathways through bioelectronic medicine for acquiring a tighter control of glucose levels in people with diabetes by: i) understanding the physiological basis that underlie this neural regulation _in vivo_ (particularly during meals), ii) studying for the first time the potential benefits of modulating these neural signals _in vivo_ for diabetes management and iii) developing novel mathematical models to be included in existing healthy and diabetes simulators.
